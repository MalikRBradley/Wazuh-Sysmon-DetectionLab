üõ°Ô∏è Sysmon + Wazuh Detection Lab (Windows 11)
This project simulates real-time endpoint detection using Sysmon and Wazuh on a Windows 11 VM. The goal was to monitor attacker-like behavior such as ping and whoami, and verify that these events were captured, parsed, and enriched by Wazuh using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

üß† What I Configured
‚úÖ Installed Sysmon64
Used the following command with a tested XML config file:
Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml

‚úÖ Edited the Wazuh agent config (ossec.conf) to include:

<localfile> <log_format>eventchannel</log_format> <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location> </localfile>
Restarted the Wazuh agent to begin collecting Sysmon logs.

üß™ Simulated Recon Behavior
Ran the following commands in PowerShell:
ping 8.8.8.8
whoami

These actions simulate basic network and identity discovery by an attacker:

ping ‚Üí T1018 ‚Äì Remote System Discovery

whoami ‚Üí T1033 ‚Äì System Owner/User Discovery

üîç Wazuh Detection & Visibility
Wazuh successfully captured the following details from Sysmon logs:

Command-line arguments

Parent process (PowerShell)

Username and session info

SHA1 and MD5 hashes of the executed binaries

Mapped behavior to MITRE ATT&CK rules

Event IDs: 1 (Process Creation), and more depending on the action

All of this was logged and visualized in the Wazuh dashboard with full JSON telemetry.
